## Features

* Minimalist & clean styling giving greater clarity
* Typography updates
* Component notes displayed more prominently
* Tabbed 'View', 'HTML', and 'Context' area made more user friendly & accessible
* More 'baked-in' styling for Documentation pages
* A solid foundation which can be used in conjunction with the [Fractal Atomic](https://github.com/AccentDesign/Fractal-Atomic) starter project or inserted in your existing Fractal project  

## Installing

Follow the instructions on how to [install Fractal](https://fractal.build/guide/installation.html) and ['Getting Started'](https://fractal.build/guide/getting-started.html) before installing the Mono subtheme using a command line tool from your project root directory.

Via the GitHub repo:

```Shell
npm install --save git+https://git@github.com/AccentDesign/Mono.git
```

## Setup

In the [setup file](https://fractal.build/guide/project-settings.html#the-fractal-js-file) for your project you can ```require``` and use the subtheme:

```Shell
// fractal.config.js
'use strict';

const fractal = module.exports = require('@frctl/fractal').create();
const webUITheme = require('mono');

// ... project setup and configuration

fractal.web.theme(webUITheme); // use the sub-classed theme
```

**Note** - On Windows, a conflicting command-line application prevents you from running Fractal commands from the project's root directory (where your ```fractal.js``` config file will live). To work around this you can rename your config file ```fractal.config.js``` and then enter the following code to your ```package.json``` file:

```
"fractal": {
    "main": "fractal.config.js"
}
```

## Fractal Atomic Starter Project

We have also developed a great set of folders & files that can be used as an awesome starter point for your Fractal UI component library. It's features include:

* Use of [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) as the templating engine
* Component folder structure based on Atomic Design principles
* Folder structure that works with Fractal
* Markup, config and markdown files for typography, buttons, form elements and tables included
* Statuses for components & documentation pages improved
* Template export function included
